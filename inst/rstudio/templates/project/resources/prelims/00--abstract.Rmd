Despite the value that longitudinal research offers for understanding psychological processes, studies in organizational research rarely use longitudinal designs. One reason for the paucity of longitudinal designs may be the challenges they present for researchers. Three challenges of particular importance are that researchers have to determine 1) how many measurements to take, 2) how to space measurements, and 3) how to design studies when participants provide data with different response schedules (time unstructuredness). In systematically reviewing the simulation literature, I found that few studies comprehensively investigated the effects of measurement number, measurement spacing, and time structuredness (in addition to sample size) on model performance. As a consequence, researchers have little guidance when trying to conduct longitudinal research. To address these gaps in the literature, I conducted a series of simulation experiments. I found poor model performance across all measurement number/sample size pairings. That is, bias and precision were never concurrently optimized under any combination of manipulated variables. Bias was often low, however, with moderate measurement numbers and sample sizes. Although precision was frequently poor, the greatest improvements in precision resulted from using either seven measurements with $N \ge 200$ or nine measurements with $N \le 100$. With time-unstructured data, model performance systematically decreased across all measurement number/sample size pairings when the model incorrectly assumed an identical response pattern across all participants (i.e., time-structured data). Fortunately, when models were equipped to handle heterogeneous response patterns using definition variables, the poor model performance observed across all measurement number/sample size pairings no longer appeared. Altogether, the results of the current simulation experiments provide guidelines for researchers interested in modelling nonlinear change.
